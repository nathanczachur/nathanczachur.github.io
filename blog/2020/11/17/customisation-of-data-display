Intro to complexity in UI

One
You have games workshop online, then each independent stores online shop.

GW store has their way of categorising boxes and troops.
Indie store has its own way too.

One may be better? But both exist together. Some people like one, or the other, or both.

Two
DOTA2, Warhammer armies. There is a large list of factions and each is good against one or more others. This type of game means you are better when you know all factions.

Other games, you don’t need to know all factions, or there is way less. This is simpler.

One may be better? But both exist together. Some people like one, or the other, or both.

Three
Games Workshop factions/ models have changed over the years. They are evolving through the timeline of Warhammer universe.

I used to like the old factions, now I don’t like them so much. I may wait and get back into the new ones.

Four
A raid in WoW has a bunch of strategies, then you can customise it for yourself too.

These are designed, then implemented, then changed after each time potentially, or after new info/ best practice is released.

Five
The meta strategy, people who monitor ALL the changes in the game to make minute changes to their strategy, then they compete in competitions to win big! Idea from 6:30 on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dqd0I2vrHS8

This work gives them a competetive advantage.

Six
Real live vs a game is different because life has way more vairations to account/ plan for. The idea of natural science experiments is good to apply in social realm, so not thinking your strategy will work forever, even more than once might not be good.

Other
Games are usually competitive, but is real life like that? Or is life less competitive? Or does it have to be competetive?

People may think humans have evolved into 1 very similar species. Thats the top level view. Other, biologists who specialisede in humans may say we are actually quite different.
