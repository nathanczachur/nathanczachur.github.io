Just some notes on a series on everything around software customisation/ configuration:

* What "opinionated" software is, how to notice it, and how to decide if it removed flexibility of the sotware by existing in code isntead of configuration.
* When to build customisable functionality
* Templating to reduce complexity/ improve UX
