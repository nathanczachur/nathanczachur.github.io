Setting up my laptop to start the #100DaysOfTechStartup challenge, there was a few tasks I routinely complete:

* This is for a Laravel setup, using Homestead.

1. Go the the latest Laravel docs for installing: https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/installation

2. Click into Homestead in a new tab: https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/homestead

3. Click into Vagrant in a new tab: https://www.vagrantup.com/

4. Download the most recent version, install it and delete the old one.

5. Go back to the Homestead tab and click into VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads

6.0 - Open VirtualBox from the teminal and delete any boxes I dont use any more.
6. Download the most recent version, install it and delete the old one.

7. Go back to the Laravel tab and click into Composer: https://getcomposer.org/

8. Download the most recent version, install it and delete the old one.

9. In terminal, run: upgrade_oh_my_zsh # I use the "fletcherm" theme for oh-my-zsh

10. In PHPStorm, check for updates and download/ install/ delete old one.

11. Go back to the Laravel tab and complete "Via Composer Create-Project"

12. Go back to the Homestead tab and complete "Per Project Installation"
* Dont run Vagrant up yet, we need to change the domain name

13. Update Homestead.yml to set sites.map to your project name # Use .test TLD

14. In terminal, in the project root, run vagrant up

15. Visit https://{your-project}.test in your browser!
